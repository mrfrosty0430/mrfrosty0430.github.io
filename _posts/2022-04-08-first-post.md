# Hey

**I'm Sung,** and this time next week, I'll be quitting my first job! Now that I'll have more time to myself, I was thinking about starting a blog, just to jot down any thoughts that I have from time to time (though my thoughts are pretty lame and all over the place).

Because I speak two language (English / Korean) I'll be spicing up my blog posts by posting in either language! maybe I'll add translate so that it'll help my Korean.

The past 2 years have been quite interesting for me. I enlisted in the Korean military on June 1st 2020, 15 days after I graduated, and spent the next 1.5 years regretting every decision I made in college. Every day I spent in the military reminded me of the time I wasted on priorities that have no meaning to me. I began to value each hour, each minute I was gifted, and though I am still lazy by nature, I try to be conscious of the time I spend, and what I do with the time gifted to me. 

I got discharged from the military on December 1st 2021 as a sergeant, and immediately started to work for a mid-sized company called Eximbay, a payment gateway company that is a little bit like Stripe, without the resources, funding, and personnel. Needless to say, it wasn't the experience I was hoping for. Maybe I'll dive deeper about my experiences in another post.

That's it for now, shoot me an email if you want to chat some more with me, but until next time, 빠이
